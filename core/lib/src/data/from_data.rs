/// # Data Guards
///
/// A data guard is a [request guard] that operates on a request's body data.
/// Data guards validate, parse, and optionally convert request body data.
/// Validation and parsing/conversion is implemented through
/// `FromTransformedData`. In other words, every type that implements
/// `FromTransformedData` is a data guard.
///
/// Data guards are used as the target of the `data` route attribute parameter.
/// A handler can have at most one data guard.
///
/// For many data guards, implementing [`FromData`] will be simpler and
/// sufficient. All types that implement `FromData` automatically implement
/// `FromTransformedData`. Thus, when possible, prefer to implement [`FromData`]
/// instead of `FromTransformedData`.
///
/// [request guard]: crate::request::FromRequest
///
/// ## Example
///
/// In the example below, `var` is used as the argument name for the data guard
/// type `DataGuard`. When the `submit` route matches, Rocket will call the
/// `FromTransformedData` implementation for the type `T`. The handler will only be called
/// if the guard returns successfully.
///
/// ```rust
/// # #[macro_use] extern crate rocket;
/// # type DataGuard = rocket::data::Data;
/// #[post("/submit", data = "<var>")]
/// fn submit(var: DataGuard) { /* ... */ }
/// # fn main() { }
/// ```
///
/// # Transforming
///
/// Data guards can optionally _transform_ incoming data before processing it
/// via an implementation of the [`FromTransformedData::transform()`] method.
/// This is useful when a data guard requires or could benefit from a reference
/// to body data as opposed to an owned version. If a data guard has no need to
/// operate on a reference to body data, [`FromData`] should be implemented
/// instead; it is simpler to implement and less error prone. All types that
/// implement `FromData` automatically implement `FromTransformedData`.
///
/// When exercising a data guard, Rocket first calls the guard's
/// [`FromTransformedData::transform()`] method and awaits on the returned
/// future, then calls the guard's [`FromTransformedData::from_data()`] method
/// and awaits on that returned future. Rocket stores data returned by
/// [`FromTransformedData::transform()`] on the stack. If `transform` returns a
/// [`Transform::Owned`], Rocket moves the data back to the data guard in the
/// subsequent `from_data` call as a `Transform::Owned`. If instead `transform`
/// returns a [`Transform::Borrowed`] variant, Rocket calls `borrow()` on the
/// owned value, producing a borrow of the associated
/// [`FromTransformedData::Borrowed`] type and passing it as a
/// `Transform::Borrowed`.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// Consider a data guard type that wishes to hold a slice to two different
/// parts of the incoming data:
///
/// ```rust
/// struct Name<'a> {
///     first: &'a str,
///     last: &'a str
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Without the ability to transform into a borrow, implementing such a data
/// guard would be impossible. With transformation, however, we can instruct
/// Rocket to produce a borrow to a `Data` that has been transformed into a
/// `String` (an `&str`).
///
/// ```rust
/// # #[macro_use] extern crate rocket;

/// # Outcomes
///

///   If the `Outcome` is [`Success`], then the `Success` value will be used as
///   the value for the data parameter.  As long as all other parsed types
///   succeed, the request will be handled by the requesting handler.
///
/// * **Failure**(Status, E)
///
///   If the `Outcome` is [`Failure`], the request will fail with the given
///   status code and error. The designated error [`Catcher`](crate::Catcher) will be
///   used to respond to the request. Note that users can request types of
///   `Result<S, E>` and `Option<S>` to catch `Failure`s and retrieve the error
///   value.
///
/// * **Forward**(Data)
///
///   If the `Outcome` is [`Forward`], the request will be forwarded to the next
///   matching request. This requires that no data has been read from the `Data`
///   parameter. Note that users can request an `Option<S>` to catch `Forward`s.
///
/// # Provided Implementations
///
/// Rocket implements `FromTransformedData` for several built-in types. Their behavior is
/// documented here.
///
///   * **Data**
///
///     The identity implementation; simply returns [`Data`] directly.
///
///     _This implementation always returns successfully._
///
///   * **Option&lt;T>** _where_ **T: FromTransformedData**
///
///     The type `T` is derived from the incoming data using `T`'s `FromTransformedData`
///     implementation. If the derivation is a `Success`, the derived value is
///     returned in `Some`. Otherwise, a `None` is returned.
///
///     _This implementation always returns successfully._
///
///   * **Result&lt;T, T::Error>** _where_ **T: FromTransformedData**
///
///     The type `T` is derived from the incoming data using `T`'s `FromTransformedData`
///     implementation. If derivation is a `Success`, the value is returned in
///     `Ok`. If the derivation is a `Failure`, the error value is returned in
///     `Err`. If the derivation is a `Forward`, the request is forwarded.
///
///   * **String**
///
///     **Note:** _An implementation of `FromTransformedData` for `String` is only available
///     when compiling in debug mode!_
///
///     Reads the entire request body into a `String`. If reading fails, returns
///     a `Failure` with the corresponding `io::Error`.
///
///     **WARNING:** Do **not** use this implementation for anything _but_
///     debugging. This is because the implementation reads the entire body into
///     memory; since the user controls the size of the body, this is an obvious
///     vector for a denial of service attack.
///
///   * **Vec&lt;u8>**
///
///     **Note:** _An implementation of `FromTransformedData` for `Vec<u8>` is only
///     available when compiling in debug mode!_
///
///     Reads the entire request body into a `Vec<u8>`. If reading fails,

/// use rocket::data::{self, Data, FromData};
/// # struct MyType;
/// # type MyError = String;
///
/// #[rocket::async_trait]

///     async fn from_data(req: &Request<'_>, data: Data) -> data::Outcome<Self, MyError> {
///         /* .. */
///         # unimplemented!()
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Example
///
/// Say that you have a custom type, `Person`:
///
/// ```rust
/// struct Person {
///     name: String,
///     age: u16
/// }
/// ```
///
/// `Person` has a custom serialization format, so the built-in `Json` type
/// doesn't suffice. The format is `<name>:<age>` with `Content-Type:
/// application/x-person`. You'd like to use `Person` as a `FromTransformedData` type so
/// that you can retrieve it directly from a client's request body:
///
/// ```rust
/// # #[macro_use] extern crate rocket;
/// # type Person = rocket::data::Data;

///     "Saved the new person to the database!"
