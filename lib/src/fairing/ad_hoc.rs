/// A ad-hoc fairing that can be created from a function or closure.
///
/// This enum can be used to create a fairing from a simple function or clusure
/// without creating a new structure or implementing `Fairing` directly.
///
/// # Usage
///
/// Use the [`on_attach`](#method.on_attach), [`on_launch`](#method.on_launch),
/// [`on_request`](#method.on_request), or [`on_response`](#method.on_response)
/// constructors to create an `AdHoc` structure from a function or closure.
/// Then, simply attach the structure to the `Rocket` instance.
///
/// # Example
///
/// The following snippet creates a `Rocket` instance with two ad-hoc fairings.
/// The first, a launch fairing, simply prints a message indicating that the
/// application is about to the launch. The second, a request fairing, rewrites
/// the method of all requests to be `PUT`.
///
/// ```rust
/// use rocket::fairing::AdHoc;
/// use rocket::http::Method;
///
/// rocket::ignite()
///     .attach(AdHoc::on_launch(|_| {
///         println!("Rocket is about to launch! Exciting! Here we go...");
///     }))
///     .attach(AdHoc::on_request(|req, _| {
///         req.set_method(Method::Put);
///     }));
/// ```
