//! # Rocket - Core API Documentation
//!
//! Hello, and welcome to the core Rocket API documentation!
//!
//! This API documentation is highly technical and is purely a reference.
//! There's an [overview](https://rocket.rs/overview) of Rocket on the main site
//! as well as a [full, detailed guide](https://rocket.rs/guide). If you'd like
//! pointers on getting started, see the
//! [quickstart](https://rocket.rs/guide/quickstart) or [getting
//! started](https://rocket.rs/guide/getting-started) chapters of the guide.
//!
//! You may also be interested in looking at the [contrib API
//! documentation](/rocket_contrib), which contains JSON and templating
//! support, among other features.
//!
//! ## Libraries
//!
//! Rocket's functionality is split into three crates:
//!
//!   1. [Core](/rocket) - The core library. Needed by every Rocket application.
//!   2. [Codegen](/rocket_codegen) - Core code generation plugin. Should always
//!      be used alongsize `rocket`, though it's not necessary.
//!   3. [Contrib](/rocket_contrib) - Provides useful functionality for many
//!      Rocket applications. Completely optional.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! The sanctioned way to use Rocket is via the code generation plugin. This
//! makes Rocket easier and safer to use and allows a somewhat stable API as
//! Rocket matures. To use Rocket with the code generation plugin in your
//! Cargo-based project, add the following to `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! [dependencies]
//! rocket = "*"
//! rocket_codegen = "*"
//! ```
//!
//! If you'll be deploying your project to [crates.io](https://crates.io),
//! you'll need to change the "*" to the current version of Rocket.
//!
//! Then, add the following to the top of your `main.rs` file:
//!
//! ```rust
//! #![feature(plugin)]
//! # #![allow(unused_attributes)]
//! #![plugin(rocket_codegen)]
//!
//! extern crate rocket;
//! ```
//!
//! See the [guide](https://rocket.rs/guide) for more information on how to
//! write Rocket applications. Here's a simple example to get you started:
//!
//! ```rust
//! #![feature(plugin)]
//! #![plugin(rocket_codegen)]
//!
//! extern crate rocket;
//!
//! #[get("/")]
//! fn hello() -> &'static str {
//!     "Hello, world!"
//! }
//!
//! fn main() {
//! # if false { // We don't actually want to launch the server in an example.
//!     rocket::ignite().mount("/", routes![hello]).launch()
//! # }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Configuration
//!
//! Rocket and Rocket libraries are configured via the `Rocket.toml` file and/or
//! `ROCKET_{PARAM}` environment variables. For more information on how to
//! configure Rocket, see the [configuration
//! section](https://rocket.rs/guide/overview/#configuration) of the guide as
//! well as the [config](/rocket/config) module documentation.
//!
//! ## Testing
//!
//! Rocket includes a small testing library that can be used to test your Rocket
//! application. For information on how to test your Rocket applications, see
//! the [testing module](/rocket/testing) documentation.
