  This is a **complete Rocket application**. It does exactly what you would
  expect. If you were to visit **/hello/John/58**, you’d see:

  <span class="callout">Hello, 58 year old named John!</span>

  If someone visits a path with an `<age>` that isn’t a `u8`, Rocket doesn’t
  just call `hello`. Instead, it tries other matching routes or returns a
  **404**.

  Form handling **is simple, declarative, and complete**: derive

  `data` parameter to a `Form` type. Rocket automatically **parses and
  validates** the form data into your structure and calls your function.

  File uploads? A breeze with [`TempFile`](@api/rocket/fs/enum.TempFile.html).
  Bad form request? Rocket doesn’t call your function! Need to know what went
  wrong? Use a `data` parameter of `Result`! Want to rerender the form with user
  input and errors? Use [`Context`](guide/requests/#context)!

  Rocket has first-class support for JSON, right out of the box. Simply derive
  `Deserialize` or `Serialize` to receive or return JSON, respectively.

  Look familiar? Forms, JSON, and all kinds of body data types work through
  Rocket’s [`FromData`](@api/rocket/data/trait.FromData.html) trait, Rocket’s
  approach to deriving types from body data. A `data` route parameter can be
  _any_ type that implements `FromData`. A value of that type will be
  deserialized automatically from the incoming request body. You can even
  implement `FromData` for your own types!

[[panels]]
name = "Routing"
checked = true
content = '''
Rocket's main task is to route incoming requests to the appropriate request
handler using your application's declared routes. Routes are declared using
Rocket's _route_ attributes. The attribute describes the requests that match the
route. The attribute is placed on top of a function that is the request handler
for that route.

As an example, consider the simple route below:

```rust
#[get("/")]
fn index() -> &'static str {
    "Hello, world!"
}
```

This `index` route matches any incoming HTTP `GET` request to `/`, the index.
The handler returns a `String`. Rocket automatically converts the string into a
well-formed HTTP response that includes the appropriate `Content-Type` and body
encoding metadata.
'''

[[panels]]
name = "Dynamic Params"
content = '''
Rocket automatically parses dynamic data in path segments into any desired type.
To illustrate, let's use the following route:

```rust
#[get("/hello/<name>/<age>")]
fn hello(name: &str, age: u8) -> String {
    format!("Hello, {} year old named {}!", age, name)
}
```

This `hello` route has two dynamic parameters, identified with angle brackets,
declared in the route URI: `<name>` and `<age>`. Rocket maps each parameter to
an identically named function argument: `name: &str` and `age: u8`. The dynamic
data in the incoming request is parsed automatically into a value of the
argument's type. The route is called only when parsing succeeds.

Parsing is directed by the
[`FromParam`](@api/rocket/request/trait.FromParam.html) trait. Rocket implements
`FromParam` for many standard types, including both `&str` and `u8`. You can
implement it for your own types, too!
'''

[[panels]]
name = "Handling Data"
content = '''
Rocket can automatically parse body data, too!

```rust
#[post("/login", data = "<login>")]
fn login(login: Form<UserLogin>) -> String {
    format!("Hello, {}!", login.name)
}
```

The dynamic parameter declared in the `data` route attribute parameter again
maps to a function argument. Here, `login` maps to `login: Form<UserLogin>`.
Parsing is again trait-directed, this time by the
[`FromData`](@api/rocket/data/trait.FromData.html) trait.

The [`Form`](@api/rocket/form/struct.Form.html) type is Rocket's [robust form
data parser](@guide/requests/#forms). It automatically parses the request body into the internal type,
here `UserLogin`. Other built-in `FromData` types include
[`Data`](@api/rocket/struct.Data.html),
[`Json`](@api/rocket/serde/json/struct.Json.html), and
[`MsgPack`](@api/rocket/serde/msgpack/struct.MsgPack.html). As always, you can
implement `FromData` for your own types, too!
'''

[[panels]]
name = "Request Guards"
content = '''
In addition to dynamic path and data parameters, request handlers can also
contain a third type of parameter: _request guards_. Request guards aren't
declared in the route attribute, and any number of them can appear in the
request handler signature.

Request guards _protect_ the handler from running unless some set of conditions
are met by the incoming request metadata. For instance, if you are writing an
API that requires sensitive calls to be accompanied by an API key in the request
header, Rocket can protect those calls via a custom `ApiKey` request guard:

```rust
#[get("/sensitive")]
fn sensitive(key: ApiKey) { ... }
```

`ApiKey` protects the `sensitive` handler from running incorrectly. In order for
Rocket to call the `sensitive` handler, the `ApiKey` type needs to be derived
through a [`FromRequest`](@api/rocket/request/trait.FromRequest.html)
implementation, which in this case, validates the API key header. Request guards
are a powerful and unique Rocket concept; they centralize application policy and
invariants through types.
'''

[[panels]]
name = "Responders"
content = '''
The return type of a request handler can be any type that implements
[`Responder`](@api/rocket/response/trait.Responder.html):

```rust
#[get("/")]
fn route() -> T { ... }
```

Above, T must implement `Responder`. Rocket implements `Responder` for many of
the standard library types including `&str`, `String`, `File`, `Option`, and
`Result`. Rocket also implements custom responders such as
[`Redirect`](@api/rocket/response/struct.Redirect.html),
[`Flash`](@api/rocket/response/struct.Flash.html), and
[`Template`](@api/rocket_dyn_templates/struct.Template.html).

The task of a `Responder` is to generate a
[`Response`](@api/rocket/response/struct.Response.html), if possible.
`Responder`s can fail with a status code. When they do, Rocket calls the
corresponding error catcher, a `catch` route, which can be declared as follows:

```rust
#[catch(404)]
fn not_found() -> T { ... }
```
'''

[[panels]]
name = "Launching"
content = '''
Finally, we get to launch our application! Rocket begins dispatching requests to
routes after they've been _mounted_ and the application has been _launched_.
These two steps, usually wrtten in a `rocket` function, look like:

```rust
#[launch]
fn rocket() -> _ {
    rocket::build().mount("/base", routes![index, another])
}
```

The `mount` call takes a _base_ and a set of routes via the `routes!` macro. The
base path (`/base` above) is prepended to the path of every route in the list,
effectively namespacing the routes. `#[launch]` creates a `main` function that
starts the server. In development, Rocket prints useful information to the
console to let you know everything is okay.

```sh
🚀 Rocket has launched from http://127.0.0.1:8000
```
