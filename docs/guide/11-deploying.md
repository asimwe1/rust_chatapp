# Deploying

This section describes deploying Rocket applications to production. It provides
a general overview as well as concrete, reusable examples for common deployment
scenarios including [self-managed deployments], [containerization], and
[fully-managed deployments].

## Overview

For any deployment, it's important to keep in mind:

  1. **Configuration**

     Minimally, Rocket will need to be configured to listen on the correct
     **port** and **address**, typically port `80` or `8080` and address
     `0.0.0.0`. Your deployment environment may have different requirements.
     Recall that by default, you can set the address and port via the
     environment variables `ROCKET_ADDRESS` and `ROCKET_PORT` as well as through
     [many other means](../configuration).

  2. **Asset Bundling**

     If your application serves assets or leverages templates, you may need to
     bundle those assets with your application binary. For example, if you serve
     static assets from the `./static` directory and enable templates, you'll
     need to ensure that those directories are present and **in the current
     working directory** that your application binary starts in.

     ```rust
     # #[macro_use] extern crate rocket;

     use rocket::fs::FileServer;
     use rocket_dyn_templates::Template;

     #[launch]
     fn rocket() -> _ {
         rocket::build()
             .mount("/", FileServer::from("./static"))
             .attach(Template::fairing())
     }
     ```

     For the application above, assuming the `template_dir` configuration
     parameter hasn't been changed, you'll need to ensure that the `static` and
     `templates` directories are placed in the current working directory that
     the application will start in. Otherwise, Rocket will refuse to launch.

  3. **Load Balancing**

     Rocket does not yet have robust support for [DDoS mitigation], so a
     production deployment will require placing Rocket behind a load balancer or
     reverse proxy that does. If you are deploying your Rocket application to
     managed environments such as Kubernetes, Heroku, or Google Cloud Run, this
     will be handled for you automatically. However, if you're deploying to a
     self-managed environment such as a VPS, we recommend placing Rocket behind
     a mature reverse proxy such as HAProxy or NGINX.

  4. **Service Management**

     As your application matures, you'll need to deploy updated versions to your
     production environment, stopping the existing application and starting the
     new one in its place. In a managed environment, you can likely rely on the
     environment to provide these mechanisms. In a self-managed environment,
     using a service manager like `systemd`, _in addition_ to a reverse proxy,
     is recommended.

     In either case, it's important to know that once a Rocket application has
     started, it will run until [graceful shutdown] is initiated. Your
     application should leverage Rocket's graceful shutdown mechanisms such as
     the [`Shutdown`] future and [shutdown fairings] to clean-up resources
     before terminating. You should also ensure that the graceful shutdown
     configuration is aligned with your environment. For example, Kubernetes
     issues a `SIGTERM` signal to initiate termination which Rocket listens for
     by default, but other environments may send other signals which you might
     need to enable as [triggers].

The following section addresses these concerns and more for common deployment
scenarios.

## Common Scenarios

### Self-Managed

In a _self-managed_ environment, you are typically responsible for all facets of
deployment and service management. In exchange, a self-managed environment
typically incurs the lowest financial cost.

You must decide whether you manage your Rocket application _directly_, by
installing, configuring, and running a service manager, load balancer, and
Rocket application, or _indirectly_ by installing and configuring an application
management service like [kubernetes], [k3s], or [dokku]. Because indirect
self-management typically revolves around [containerization], covered in the
next section, we focus on _direct_ self-management here.

[kubernetes]: https://kubernetes.io/
[k3s]: https://k3s.io/
[dokku]: https://dokku.com/

Our recommendation for a direct self-managed deployment is to:

  - **Compile for the remote target (i.e, the VPS), bundle, and copy.**

    Compile your application for the remote target and bundle the binary with
    its assets. You may need to cross-compile for the remote target: we
    recommend using [`cargo-zigbuild`]. Before cross-compiling, you'll also need
    to install the Rust toolchain for the target.

    The script below performs these steps, producing a gzipped archive ready to
    be copied to a remote server.

    ```sh
    ## configure these for your environment
    PKG="app"                                    # cargo package name
    TARGET="x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu"            # remote target
    ASSETS=("Rocket.toml" "static" "templates")  # list of assets to bundle
    BUILD_DIR="target/${TARGET}/release"         # cargo build directory

    ## ensure target toolchain is present
    rustup target add $TARGET

    ## cross-compile
    cargo zigbuild --target $TARGET --release

    ## bundle
    tar -cvzf "${PKG}.tar.gz" "${ASSETS[@]}" -C "${BUILD_DIR}" "${PKG}"
    ```

  - **Run the application as a managed service.**

    Once the bundle is at the remote server, use a service manager to start,
    monitor, and stop the application. As an example, assuming the bundle
    produced by the script above was extracted to `/www/pkg`, the following
    `systemd` service file defines a service for the application:

    ```ini
    [Unit]
    Description=Rocket Application
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    Type=simple
    WorkingDirectory=/www/pkg
    ExecStart=/www/pkg/pkg
    User=pkg
    Group=pkg
    Restart=always

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

    You'll want to modify the service file as needed. Consider particularly the
    `User` and `Group`: that user/group will need to be authorized to access the
    `WorkingDirectory`.

    Write the service file to the `systemd` services directory (for example,
    `/etc/systemd/system/pkg.service`). You can now interact with the service as
    usual:

    ```sh
    systemctl [status,enable,start,stop,restart,disable] pkg
    ```

    If the service is running but the server doesn't appear to be responding,
    ensure that you've set the address and port you expect in the `[default]`,
    `[global]`, and/or `[production]` sections of `Rocket.toml` or via another
    configuration source. For example, you may wish to set systemd `Service`
    environment variables:

    ```diff
    [Service]
    + Environment=ROCKET_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1
    + Environment=ROCKET_PORT=8000
    ```

  - **Configure a reverse proxy for the application.**

    Finally, configure a reverse proxy to serve requests to the running
    application server. As an example, a simple NGINX reverse proxy
    configuration file for the application above might look like:

    ```conf
    server {
        listen 80;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        }
    }
    ```

    Note that we configure NGINX to forward the actual remote IP via the
    `X-Real-IP` header, which Rocket uses by default via [`ip_header`].
    Additionally, the scheme is forwarded via `X-Forwarded-Proto`, but it must
    be explicitly configured via [`proxy_proto_header`] for Rocket to consider.

[`proxy_proto_header`]: @api/master/rocket/config/struct.Config.html#structfield.proxy_proto_header

### Containerization

In a _containerization_ environment, you are responsible for writing a
`Dockerfile` or `Containerfile` which you provide to an application platform.
The platform may be self-managed, as with [k3s] or [dokku], or fully-managed, as
with Google Cloud Run or Heroku.

Below you'll find an example of a `Dockerfile` that:

  - Builds the application with the latest stable Rust compiler.
  - Uses `--mount=type=cache` to avoid recompiling dependencies.
  - Uses a second stage to create a slim (~100MiB), ready-to-deploy image with
    only what's needed.
  - Bundles all of an application's assets in the container.

```dockerfile
FROM docker.io/rust:1-slim-bookworm AS build

## cargo package name: customize here or provide via --build-arg
ARG pkg=rocket-app

WORKDIR /build

COPY . .

RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/build/target \
    --mount=type=cache,target=/usr/local/cargo/registry \
    --mount=type=cache,target=/usr/local/cargo/git \
    set -eux; \
    cargo build --release; \
    objcopy --compress-debug-sections target/release/$pkg ./main

################################################################################

FROM docker.io/debian:bookworm-slim

WORKDIR /app

## copy the main binary
COPY --from=build /build/main ./

## copy runtime assets which may or may not exist
COPY --from=build /build/Rocket.tom[l] ./static
COPY --from=build /build/stati[c] ./static
COPY --from=build /build/template[s] ./templates

## ensure the container listens globally on port 8080
ENV ROCKET_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0
ENV ROCKET_PORT=8080

CMD ./main
```

You will need to modify the `pkg` `ARG` or provide it via the command-line:

```sh
docker build --build-arg pkg=cargo_package_name -t app  .
```

You may also need to make the following changes:

  * Add/remove/modify `ENV` variables as needed.
  * Modify the expected `target/release/$pkg` directory.
  * Add more assets to `COPY` to the final image.

Finally, we recommend the following `.dockerignore` file to avoid copying
unnecessary artifacts:

```gitignore
target
.cargo
**/*.sh
**/*.tar.gz
```

### Fully-Managed

In a _fully-managed_ environment, you provide a service with your source code
and instructions on how to build and run your application. The `Dockerfile` in
the [containerization] section, coupled with a configuration file that instructs
the service to build it, may be one such example.

Because the specifics on deploying to a fully-managed environment depend on the
environment, we provide only the following general guidelines:

  * **Ensure the address and port are set as required.**

    Most environments require your application to listen on `0.0.0.0`. Ensure
    `ROCKET_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0`.

    Some environments require your application to listen on specific ports.
    Remember to set the port as required. For example, if the service requires
    your application to listen on a port provided by a `$PORT` environment
    variable, set `ROCKET_PORT=$PORT` before starting your application.

  * **Compile or run with `--release`.**

    Ensure that you run `cargo` commands with `--release`. Besides compiling
    with optimizations, compiling with `--release` sets the default
    [configuration profile] to `release`.

  * **Enable debug logging if the application misbehaves.**

    The default log level in `--release` (the release profile) is `critical`.
    This level may omit messages helpful in understanding application
    misbehavior. To reenable those messages, set `ROCKET_LOG_LEVEL=debug`.
